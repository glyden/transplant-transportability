# Weighted estimators of survival under transportable random DTRs

This repository contains the code to simulate survival data for patients awaiting organ transplant and fit a nonparametric weighted estimator of survival under a generalized representative intervention that incorporates wait time, as defined in "Transportability of causal inference under probabilistic dynamic treatment regimes for organ transplant" by Lyden, et al.
