# Weighted estimators of survival under a generalized representative intervention for organ transplant

This repository contains the code to simulate survival data for patients awaiting organ transplant and fit a nonparametric weighted estimator of survival under a generalized representative intervention. This concept is defined in "Transportability of causal inference under probabilistic dynamic treatment regimes for organ transplant" by Lyden, et al.
